HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT ON ANY LAPTOP
========================================

STEP 1: PREREQUISITES
---------------------
Install the following on your friend's laptop:

1. Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or higher)
   Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   
2. Git
   Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   
3. Android Studio (for Android development)
   Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   OR
   VS Code with Flutter extension
   
4. Python 3.8+ (for backend - optional if only testing app)
   Download from: https://python.org


STEP 2: CLONE THE REPOSITORY
-----------------------------
Open terminal/command prompt and run:

git clone https://github.com/AdhimulamBhargavSaiViswanath-05/CommunityServiceProjectGovtSchemes.git
cd CommunityServiceProjectGovtSchemes


STEP 3: INSTALL FLUTTER DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------
In the project directory, run:

flutter pub get

This will download all required Flutter packages.


STEP 4: CHECK FLUTTER SETUP
----------------------------
Run this to verify everything is installed:

flutter doctor

Fix any issues shown (Android SDK, licenses, etc.)


STEP 5: CONNECT DEVICE OR EMULATOR
-----------------------------------
Option A - Physical Android Phone:
1. Enable USB debugging on phone
2. Connect via USB cable
3. Verify with: flutter devices

Option B - Android Emulator:
1. Open Android Studio
2. AVD Manager → Create Virtual Device
3. Start the emulator
4. Verify with: flutter devices

Option C - Run on Windows/Chrome:
Just use: flutter devices (no setup needed)


STEP 6: RUN THE APP
-------------------
For Android Phone/Emulator:
flutter run

For Windows:
flutter run -d windows

For Chrome Browser:
flutter run -d chrome

The app will build and launch automatically!


STEP 7: BACKEND IS ALREADY LIVE
--------------------------------
The backend is deployed on Render.com and accessible at:
https://communityserviceprojectgovtschemes.onrender.com

The app will automatically connect to this live backend.
No need to run backend locally unless you want to modify it.


OPTIONAL - RUN BACKEND LOCALLY
-------------------------------
If you want to run backend on local machine:

1. Navigate to backend folder:
   cd backend

2. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask server:
   python server.py

4. Update app to use local backend:
   In lib/services/backend_api_service.dart, change:
   backendUrl = 'http://localhost:5000'

5. Restart the Flutter app


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: Flutter not recognized
Solution: Add Flutter to system PATH

Problem: Android licenses not accepted
Solution: flutter doctor --android-licenses

Problem: Build fails with Gradle error
Solution: 
- Delete android/.gradle folder
- Delete build folder
- Run: flutter clean
- Run: flutter pub get
- Try again: flutter run

Problem: Backend sleeping (Render.com free tier)
Solution: Open this URL in browser to wake it up:
https://communityserviceprojectgovtschemes.onrender.com/health

Problem: Disk space error
Solution: 
- Set GRADLE_USER_HOME to drive with more space
- Windows: $env:GRADLE_USER_HOME = "D:\gradle_cache"
- Linux/Mac: export GRADLE_USER_HOME=~/gradle_cache
