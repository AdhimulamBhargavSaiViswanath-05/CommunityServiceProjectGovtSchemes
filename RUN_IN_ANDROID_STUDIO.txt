TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
==============================

Issue 1: "Flutter SDK not found"
Solution:
- Go to: File → Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Flutter
- Set Flutter SDK path (e.g., C:\src\flutter or where you installed)
- Click Apply

Issue 2: "Gradle build failed"
Solution:
- In Android Studio terminal:
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
- Delete these folders: android/.gradle and build/
- Try running again

Issue 3: Phone not detected
Solution:
- Disconnect and reconnect USB cable
- Try different USB port
- Enable "File Transfer" mode on phone (not just charging)
- Disable and re-enable USB debugging
- Run in terminal: adb devices (should show your device)

Issue 4: "Insufficient storage" error
Solution:
- Free up space on C: drive (need 3-5 GB)
- Or set Gradle to use different drive:
  In terminal: $env:GRADLE_USER_HOME = "D:\gradle_cache"
  Then run: flutter run

Issue 5: Build taking too long
Solution:
- First build takes 5-10 minutes (normal)
- Subsequent builds are faster (1-2 minutes)
- Make sure antivirus isn't scanning the project folder

Issue 6: "minSdkVersion" error
Solution:
- Open: android/app/build.gradle
- Find: minSdkVersion
- Change to: minSdkVersion 21 (or higher)
- Save and try again

Issue 7: Backend not responding in app
Solution:
- Backend might be sleeping (Render.com free tier)
- Open in browser: https://communityserviceprojectgovtschemes.onrender.com/health
- Wait 30-60 seconds for backend to wake up
- Restart the app
